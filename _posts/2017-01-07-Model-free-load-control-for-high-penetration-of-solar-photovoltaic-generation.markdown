I worked on this project during the last year of my thesis with OakRidge national Lab, TN, USA. The goal was to design a control algorithm that would help dissipate the solar energy wisely accross different consuming HVAC units, in order to maintain a certain temperature comfort, while simultaneously maintaining a certain stability in the grid.


# Introduction 
In this project we introduced a new model-free control (MFC) mechanism that enables the local distribution level circuit con- sumption of the photovoltaic (PV) generation by local building loads, in particular, distributed heating, ventilation and air con- ditioning (HVAC) units. The local consumption of PV generation will help minimize the impact of PV generation on the distribu- tion grid, reduce the required battery storage capacity for PV penetration, and increase solar PV generation penetration levels. The proposed MFC approach with its corresponding intelligent controllers does not require any precise model for buildings, where a reliable modeling is a demanding task. Even when assuming the availability of a good model, the various building architectures would compromise the performance objectives of any model-based control strategy. The objective is to consume most of the PV generation locally while maintaining occupants comfort and physical constraints of HVAC units. That is, by enabling proper scheduling of responsive loads temporally and spatially to minimize the difference between demand and PV production, it would be possible to reduce voltage variations and two-way power flow. Computer simulations show promising results where a significant proportion of the PV generation can be consumed by building HVAC units with the help of intelligent control.
